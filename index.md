<h1>Welcome to FireStorm, we are a coding studio based in the UK working to bring you the entertainment you deserve.</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">This site is work in progress so be prepared for it to not be finished.</span></p>
<h2>Current Plans</h2>
<p>&nbsp;The main project currently is a First Person Shooter which may include some multiplayer aspects. In future we also plan to make some mobile games, these will only be on android as it is much easier to get an app onto the Google Play Store than the iPhone App Store. As we grow this may change.</p>
